The conflict is caused by:
    gdxtools 0.1.85 depends on gams
    gdxtools 0.1.84 depends on gams
    gdxtools 0.1.83 depends on gams
    gdxtools 0.1.82 depends on gams
    gdxtools 0.1.81 depends on gams
    gdxtools 0.1.72 depends on gams
    gdxtools 0.1.71 depends on gams
    gdxtools 0.1.8 depends on gams
    gdxtools 0.1.7 depends on gams
    gdxtools 0.1.6 depends on gams
    gdxtools 0.1.5 depends on gams
    gdxtools 0.1.4 depends on gams

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
